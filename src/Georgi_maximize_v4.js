Purpose: Haggling competition from Hola
https://github.com/hola/challenge_haggling

Sometime after submission I will push the this script and development process
to repositoty: https://github.com/Georgi57/challenge_haggling

***General comments***
I like contained solutions and test them as much as I can.
As an embedded engineer I am typically limited in resources so I make simple solutions.
In this case I did not spend much time on optimization, just tweaking the parameters.
I also never used nodejs in my work before, so this was a good way to get to know it (at least basic functionality).

***Overview***
The base idea of the solution is to give best value offers (from my side) to the opponent in descreasing order.
This is done using an offer tree. Tree is based on value to me plus opponents perceived valueless items.
Although opponents value prediction plays a very small role.
If opponent does not accept my offers, last rounds are used to look through his offers and select the best of those.
I am not concerned about the value the opponents gets out of the offer, merely statistically increasing my own.

***Process***
I will describe some step I have take, mostly for my own reflection.

1. towards the tree
First thing I did was to organize my offers in decreasing value.
I tried decreasing the offer by the least valued item. This was fine for starters.
The list of item values in ascending order is still in the code, but not used. At least I understood how sorting works.
Quickly realized that this would take many offers off the list. I moved on to the tree solution.
Started testing against myself. The idea was to get the best value offer for both parties.

2. Perfect offer
I added a definition of a perfect offer - all non-zero items combined. My perfect offer is used to start haggling.

3. Opponents offers
I started saving opponents offers with a thought of analysis later.
Next idea I had was to check when the opponent had any good offer at the end of the haggling.
Done. And pretty useful feature.

4. Acceptance levels
At this point I added two variables: acceptance and minimal_acceptance.
The idea was to start with acceptance and going through the offers decrease it until minimal_acceptance is reached.
Me accepting offers also depends on the acceptance level. So when I offer lower value, I accept lower values as well.
Next I added the last change acceptance - the value I could accept as last resort.
In the end there was lots of tweaking these values.

5. First solution
At this point I decided to fix v1 of the solution, which worked on all fronts,
Not the best value over time though, some decided to continue development.

6. Opponents offer analysis
I added opponents value list very early on along with my own value list but have not used it until now.
Simplified opponents offer values. Initially wanted to decrease and increase the value of the items according to offers.
Now I just increased the value if an items was in the offer.
Then I finally added consideration in the tree. A tried to tweak it a lot.
For that I added a selftest.cmd script to check my tweaks.

7. Optimizations
Now I started running my solution on the server, checking against other people continuously.
Fixed v2 solution and created pyhton script to check statistics in a simple way.
From here on it seems I only did tweaking and optimizations.
I ran 24h test, comparing the my scripts with other people statistically.
And decisions on the acceptance level were done based on the statistics.

8. Final testing (I initially thought)
Second test resulted in suprizing results of 8 being the best minimal acceptance level.

9. Final final testing
After first submition I did not do anything for a day and then reaslized that I was not testing my solution on the best server.
Most people were cheking it on standard_1s server. So I now I did the final round of testing.
Understood that opponents offer selection acceptance value was too low. So the latest configuration:
Initial acceptance: 10
Minimal acceptance: 8
Last chance acceptance: 7
Last offer (when opponent start haggling): 1 (as long as there is gain at all)
